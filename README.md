## Interpreters Solutions
This repository serves as a collection of **_my own personal contributions (synthesized without glancing at external solutions)_** to various problems on [Interpreters](https://www.codewars.com/).
This competitive programming site contains an interesting plethora of specialized CS topics that will rarely be touched upon under normal
contexts, such as working as a software engineer or being a full stack developer, but nonetheless, it's fascinating to explore and
gain some appreciation towards these esoteric challenges.
